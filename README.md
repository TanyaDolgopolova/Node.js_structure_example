# Express + Node.js Structure Example
The main purpose of this repository is to show a working Node.js API Server  and workflow for writing Node code in TypeScript.

# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter.git <project_name>
```
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!

# TypeScript + Node
Feel free to use this as a reference for converting other Node.js projects to TypeScript.
The most obvious difference in a TypeScript + Node project is the folder structure.
In a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate _source_  and _distributable_ files.
TypeScript (`.ts`) files live in your `src` folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (`.js`) in the `dist` folder.
The `test` and `views` folders remain top level as expected.

## Getting TypeScript
TypeScript itself is simple to add to any project with `npm`.
```
npm install -D typescript
```
If you're using VS Code then you're good to go!
VS Code will detect and use the TypeScript version you have installed in your `node_modules` folder.
For other editors, make sure you have the corresponding [TypeScript plugin](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links).
